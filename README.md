**WOLS** is an acronym for **W**ireless@SG **O**n **L**inux **S**ystem (WOLS) to assist users in
creating the required 802.11x wireless connection profile to connect to the free
nationwide public hotspot network 
[Wireless@SG](https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/wireless-at-sg).

The name is also a subtle sarcastic jab at a **S-L-O-W** Wi-Fi connection when 
reversed.

It is a Java-based user setup tool that is currently developed and tested to 
run on [Ubuntu 20.04.6 (Focal Fossa)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/) and 
[Fedora Linux 38](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/announcing-fedora-linux-38).
